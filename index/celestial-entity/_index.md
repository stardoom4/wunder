<p>I am Studying science and creating a fictional world in my mind. I am not a programmer but I do know some computer basics like I can <code>git clone</code>, clear the cache using <code>sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop-caches</code> and I also know how to use Linux (basics to get my things done), Infact I sometimes use ParrotOS which is based on Debian. I have some experience in HTML and CSS also.</p><br>

<blockquote>I know quite clearly what I want out of my life. Life and my emotions are the only things I am conscious of. I love the consciousness of life and I want as much of it as I can get. But the span of one's life is limited. What comes after death no one knows. Nor do I care. Since, therefore, I cannot increase the content of life by increasing its duration, I will increase it by increasing its intensity. Art, music, poetry and everything else … I do have this one purpose — increasing the intensity of my consciousness of life. ~ Homi Jahangir Bhabha</blockquote>
