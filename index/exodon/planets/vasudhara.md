Vasud-hara: The Birthplace of Humanity
  Vasud-hara is the home planet of humans, where the Mother Goddess gave birth to the first men. It is a habitable planet located in the Sol system, predominantly covered by water, which constitutes 68% of the planet's surface.

    Inhabitants: Humans

    Population: 7.4 billion

    Continents: 4

    Planetary System: Sol

    Fate: Destroyed by the red giant phase of its star

 
Geography and Climate
  The geography of Vasud-hara was an intricate mosaic of deep oceans, extensive archipelagos, and scattered continents. The planet's oceans were remarkably deep, creating vertical habitats extending miles below the surface. Despite the vast expanses of water, the remaining 32% of the surface consisted of lush landmasses, including verdant forests, expansive plains, and towering mountain ranges. The planet experienced a mild and stable climate due to its balanced axial tilt and the moderating influence of its vast oceans.  

    Equatorial Regions: Warm, teeming with vibrant coral reefs and marine forests.

    Polar Regions: Colder but ice-free due to geothermal activity and a thick atmospheric blanket.

 
Technological Advancements
  Despite its eventual destruction, Vasud-hara was a beacon of technological advancement. The planet's civilizations achieved remarkable progress in various fields, including engineering, and space exploration. The Men created their first light speed engine , teleportation ring , and the fleet of Ships which eventually helped them in escaping the destruction of planet.  
Causes of Destruction
 

    Planetary Core Stagnation: The core of Vasud-hara ceased to rotate, causing the planet's magnetic field to vanish. This left the planet vulnerable to solar flares, leading to the destruction of its ecology, though not the planet itself. 

    Red Giant Phase of Sol: As Sol entered the red giant phase, it engulfed Vasud-hara, resulting in the planet's complete destruction.

Notes:
The name Vasudhara means "stream of gems" in Sanskrit. She is the Buddhist goddess of Wealth, prosperity, and abundance
